Redrain is a fairly simple console-based podcast downloader written in
python.  After configuration, it operates without any interaction from the
user, making it well-suited for automated tasks.

DEPENDENCIES
	Python 2.6 (http://www.python.org)
	Feedparser 5 (http://feedparser.org)
        - BeautifulSoup (helps Feedparser)

SETUP
	At present, there is no setup script nor any means to add the program
to your system globally as the state of the program is "barely even alpha."
Right now, it's best to simply unzip+untar the files to their own
directory and type "python redrain-console.py" from inside the directory.
	The first time that you run Redrain, it will create a configuration
directory (~/.redrain) and populate it with empty files and then ask you
for a list of podcast feed urls.  You should be able to acquire these from
the site providing the show in most browsers.

USAGE
	Typical invocation of Redrain is simply done by typing:

	./redrain-console.py [options]

	on your command line, if you're on any *nix.  Windows users will have to
	type:

	python redrain-console.py [options]

	If your system has multiple versions of Python installed, you may need
	to specify and use python2.6 instead.
	
	All options that would be specified in the config file may be specified
	on the command line. In addition, you may specify an alternate config
	file by adding "config=filename" to the command line.  This is useful
	if you want to keep your video and audio podcasts in different places.

	Note that options specified on the command line override config file
	options for that execution.

	One configuration item is typically found on the command line, and that
	is the "skipdl" option.  Providing "skipdl=true" will cause Redrain
	to only pretend to download files.  Useful the first time that you've
	run the program or for testing.

FILES
	Here's a list of the configuration files and what they do.

	~/.redrain/config - Flat text file containing a list of key/value pairs
	that is loaded when the program starts.  For the most part, these
	simply reference other files that are loaded when the program starts.
	The reasoning behind this is so that multiple configurations can be
	used and selected at run time in the future.  Configuration file 
	keys are below (note that these may also be specified on the command
	line) :

	- f_oldshows -- the location of the 'oldshows' file.

	- f_podcasts -- the location of the 'podcasts' file.

	- f_lastrun -- the location of the 'lastrun' file.

	- d_download_dir -- where you want podcasts to be downloaded.  Some
	preliminary effort has been made to make sure that your choice of 
	directory is correct for your operating system, but be sure to test
	these things before you rely on it :)  Also, the program *usually*
	appends a slash to the end of this entry to make sure that the files
	are actually going into the chosen directory; this task is not fully
	complete yet.

	- r_oldshows -- Function removed.

	~/.redrain/podcasts - Flat text file, formatted similarly to 'config'.
	Stores a list of key/value pairs the describe given podcasts.  
	There are currently four supported keys, listed below:
	
	- feedurl -- This is the actual URL of the podcast feed, and this is
	the only mandatory key.  Entries without this key will simply be
	ignored.  Note that this is for the actual RSS feed, not the website
	itself.

	- nicename -- This is the name of the show that is displayed on screen.
	While this is usually generated on its own during configuration, it is
	often the case that you'll want to rewrite this for your own purposes.

	- skip -- If this key is present and the value is 'true', the show will be
	skipped on this run.  Useful if there's a show that you don't want to 
	download for a while and would rather not comment out several lines in your
	podcasts file.

	- dl_file_name -- This is for customizing downloaded file names.  Some
	shows have frankly bizarre conventions for their titles (which is what
	is used as the default file name) and this key provides a work-around
	for that.  The key describes the filename convention that you would
	like Redrain to use.  An examples :

	dl_file_name=The Onion Radio News - %{title}

	(this could also be written as %{nicename} - %{title} )

	In short, each occurrence of %{something} is replaced with special
	local values as each file is downloaded, and the extension for the file
	is pulled from the url and appended to the custom filename.  Valid 
	fields are as follows :

	date - date the show was updated
	time - time the show was updated
	title - posted title for the episode
	guid - GUID for the episode
	showname - show name generated from feed
	nicename - user-provided "nice" name (described above)
	ltime - local time you downloaded the show
	ldate - local date you downloaded the show

	~/.redrain/oldshows - Flat text file containing data used in 
	identifying shows that have already been downloaded.  Each line starts
	with either "guid=" or "url=", indicating that kind of entry it is.  
	The remainder of the line is the relevant data.

	~/.redrain/lastrun - A flat text file that shows the last time that the
	program was run.  Simply five lines, one each for year, month, day, 
	hour, and minute.  The date tracked is always in GMT.
